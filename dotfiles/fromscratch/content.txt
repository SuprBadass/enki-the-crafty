### Convert to swift

Instead of doing a brute force obj-C to swift conversion, I suggest taking a more iterative approach where we convert the app to swift in steps. 

Overall goals:

* Get the core of the app functional
	 * xml parsing/rendering logic
	 * synching template
	 * synching of data 
* Available in the App Store (with sample data set)
* Progress when doing long operation such as importing images (basically re-write image selection logic)
	* multiple image selection : https://github.com/nohana/NohanaImagePicker
* Support for iPad portrait


 
### Rewrite to react native 

multiple image picker is not native to iOS
swift: https://github.com/nohana/NohanaImagePicker)
react native: https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker
I suggest we fix it so that it shows progress for cloud picture download"



visudo and then add

%sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALLGreg Rowe [3:02 PM]
add NOPASSWD: prior to the last ALL in sudoers
