|> Build suggestion/wishes
	It should be dead simple for the end user (ie the developers) KISS
	It should reduce the risk for manual errors
	It should be automated as much as possible
	
	Developers should not have to browse to the selected build tool to create a job for their project master and/or specific branch name
	
	Developers should not have to browse to the selected build tool to fire a build job.

	Developers should not have to browse to the selected build tool to fire a deploy job.

|> My current build solution:
	-> Not having to create job manually
		When creating a new container service, I don't want to have to go to jenkins or team city or whatever to create a build job.  There should be a way where it is created automatically for me when I either start my micro service or the first time I try to create the container and upload it.
	
	-> Not having to fire job manually
		This should be automatic.   Either via a repo change, or a manual request via dev tool (or script).  For instance, most of the service I worked on can be build and deploy via one command line:
		$ npm publish:minor (runs test locally, check for security issues, tag and push)
		$ npm jenkins:build (fires the build job for the project on jenkins
		$ npm jenkins:deploy -f CI (deploy to CI).
		
		This could be build tech agnostic and we could have plugins for our fav IDE to publish, build and deploy.

	-> Add code coverage
	-> Ensure tests are provided
	-> add Notes to dump todos
	-> npm-check to see what is used or not
	-> npm-dview/david to output dependencies
	-> jshint (doesn't work well with es7-8, async)
